## 🎯 IMMEDIATE TESTING REQUIRED

The user should now test these specific scenarios:

### 1. Job Creation Validation

- Try invalid salary range (min > max) → Should show validation error

### 2. Candidate Creation Validation  
- Try creating candidate with empty name → Should show validation error
- Try creating candidate with invalid email → Should show validation error
- Try uploading invalid file types → Should show validation error

### 3. Bulk Upload Validation

## 📋 REMAINING MINOR ISSUES

1. **Pipeline Stage Counts** - Some stages may show inaccurate counts (minor UX issue)
2. **AI Features** - Cannot fully test without OpenAI API key configuration  
3. **Bulk Operations UI** - Bulk candidate actions need UI completion

## 🚀 NEXT PHASE RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Configure OpenAI API Key** to enable full AI testing
2. **Test all critical fixes** in production environment
3. **Verify candidate profile modal** functionality 
4. **Complete bulk operations UI** implementation
5. **Fix pipeline stage counting** logic
6. **Add mobile responsiveness testing**
