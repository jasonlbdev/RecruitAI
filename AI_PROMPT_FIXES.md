# ðŸš¨ AI PROMPT SYSTEM FIXES

## **Critical Issues Identified and Fixed**

### **1. Job-Specific AI Scoring Weights Were Completely Ignored**
**Problem:** Jobs have custom AI scoring weights (experience: 40%, skills: 30%, etc.) configured in the UI, but the AI analysis completely ignored these weights and used generic prompts for all jobs.

**Root Cause:** 
- `ai-analyze.ts` had missing import for `resumeAnalysisPromptSetting`
- Both `ai-analyze.ts` and `upload-resume.ts` used hardcoded prompts instead of job-specific weighted analysis

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// Before: Generic prompt for all jobs
analysisPrompt = "Analyze this resume and provide insights."

// After: Job-aware weighted prompts  
const weights = jobDetails.scoringWeights || { experience: 30, skills: 30, location: 15, education: 15, salary: 10 };

const weightedInstructions = `
**SCORING PRIORITIES FOR THIS ${jobDetails.title} ROLE:**
- Experience/Career Level: ${weights.experience}% weight - ${weights.experience > 30 ? 'CRITICAL FOCUS' : 'HIGH FOCUS'}
- Technical Skills Match: ${weights.skills}% weight - ${weights.skills > 30 ? 'CRITICAL FOCUS' : 'HIGH FOCUS'}
- Location/Remote Compatibility: ${weights.location}% weight
- Education Requirements: ${weights.education}% weight  
- Salary Alignment: ${weights.salary}% weight
`;
```

### **2. Broken Template Variable System**
**Problem:** AI prompts had template variables like `{resume_text}`, `{job_requirements}`, `{job_description}` but they were being overwritten with hardcoded JSON extraction templates.

**Before:**
```typescript
// Template variables got replaced with static JSON
analysisPrompt = analysisPrompt.replace('{resume_text}', resumeText)
// Then immediately overwritten with hardcoded extraction template
const extractionPrompt = `${analysisPrompt}\n\nIMPORTANT: Please extract...{hardcoded JSON}`
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Template variables properly replaced with job-specific data
analysisPrompt = analysisPrompt
  .replace('{resume_text}', fileContent)
  .replace('{job_requirements}', jobDetails.requirements?.join(', ') || 'Not specified')
  .replace('{job_description}', jobDetails.description || 'Not specified');

// Then enhanced with job-specific context
analysisPrompt = `${analysisPrompt}\n\n${weightedInstructions}`;
```

### **3. Missing Import Error in ai-analyze.ts**
**Problem:** `resumeAnalysisPromptSetting` was undefined, causing the AI analysis endpoint to fail.

**Fix:** Added missing import and proper database access:
```typescript
import { getMemoryDB } from './init-db';
const resumeAnalysisPromptSetting = db.system_settings.find((s: any) => s.key === 'resume_analysis_prompt');
```

### **4. No Dynamic Job Customization**
**Problem:** All job analyses used identical prompts regardless of:
- Job title, department, location requirements
- Required experience level  
- Remote vs on-site preferences
- Salary ranges
- Specific technical requirements

**Fix:** Created comprehensive job-specific context:
```typescript
**JOB-SPECIFIC CONTEXT:**
- Position: ${jobDetails.title}
- Department: ${jobDetails.department}  
- Experience Level Required: ${jobDetails.experienceLevel}
- Location: ${jobDetails.location} ${jobDetails.isRemote ? '(Remote OK)' : '(On-site required)'}
- Salary Range: $${jobDetails.salaryMin} - $${jobDetails.salaryMax}
- Key Requirements: ${jobDetails.requirements?.join(', ')}
```

### **5. Inconsistent Scoring Between Upload and Analysis**
**Problem:** Resume upload (`upload-resume.ts`) and AI analysis (`ai-analyze.ts`) used completely different prompt formats and scoring methods.

**Fix:** Standardized both endpoints to use:
- Same job-aware prompt system
- Same weighted scoring priorities  
- Same template variable replacement
- Consistent response format with job context

## **Enhanced AI Prompt Features**

### **Priority-Based Analysis**
The AI now focuses on high-priority areas based on job-specific weights:
- **CRITICAL FOCUS** (>30% weight): Detailed analysis required
- **HIGH FOCUS** (20-30% weight): Significant attention  
- **STANDARD FOCUS** (<20% weight): Basic coverage

### **Job-Specific Response Format**
AI responses now include:
```json
{
  "experienceScore": "0-100 score (35% weight for this role)",
  "skillsScore": "0-100 score (40% weight for this role)",
  "overallScore": "weighted composite based on job priorities",
  "aiAnalysisSummary": "summary tailored to this specific role"
}
```

### **Bias Detection & Diversity**
Enhanced prompts include:
- Potential bias indicators
- Diversity considerations
- Fair evaluation guidelines

## **Files Modified**
1. **`api/ai-analyze.ts`** - Added job-aware weighted prompts
2. **`api/upload-resume.ts`** - Fixed template variables and job-specific scoring
3. **`api/init-db.ts`** - Enhanced prompt templates (comprehensive prompts already existed)

## **Testing Required**
1. Create a job with custom AI weights (e.g., 50% skills, 25% experience, 15% location, 10% education)
2. Upload a resume for that specific job  
3. Verify AI analysis emphasizes skills heavily in the response
4. Test bulk upload with different job configurations
5. Compare analysis results between different job weight configurations

## **Impact**
- âœ… AI now adapts analysis based on job-specific priorities
- âœ… Consistent scoring across upload and analysis endpoints  
- âœ… Template variables properly utilized
- âœ… Job context included in all AI decisions
- âœ… Weighted scoring reflects recruiter preferences
- âœ… Fixed missing imports and errors
