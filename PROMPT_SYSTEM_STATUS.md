# 🎯 AI PROMPT SYSTEM STATUS SUMMARY

## **BEFORE: What Was Broken**

❌ **Job-specific AI scoring weights completely ignored**
- Jobs configured with custom weights (e.g., 40% skills, 30% experience) 
- AI used generic analysis for ALL jobs regardless of priorities
- No difference between software engineer vs sales role analysis

❌ **Missing imports causing API failures**
- `ai-analyze.ts` had undefined `resumeAnalysisPromptSetting`
- Caused 500 errors during candidate analysis

❌ **Template variables broken**
- Prompts had `{resume_text}`, `{job_requirements}` placeholders
- Variables replaced then immediately overwritten with hardcoded JSON
- Job-specific data never reached the AI

❌ **No job context in AI decisions**
- Same prompt for remote vs on-site positions
- No salary range considerations  
- No department-specific requirements
- No experience level adaptation

## **AFTER: What's Now Working**

✅ **Dynamic job-aware AI analysis**
```
For a "Senior Frontend Developer" with weights: Skills 45%, Experience 35%, Location 20%

AI receives:
**EXTRACTION PRIORITIES FOR THIS Senior Frontend Developer ROLE:**
- Technical Skills Match: 45% weight - CRITICAL FOCUS
- Experience/Career Level: 35% weight - CRITICAL FOCUS

## **Testing Instructions**

   - Job B: "Engineering Manager" (Experience: 50%, Leadership: 30%, Skills: 20%)

2. **Upload same resume to both jobs**

3. **Verify AI responses differ:**
   - Job A analysis should focus heavily on technical skills
   - Job B analysis should emphasize management experience and leadership

4. **Check scoring reflects weights:**
